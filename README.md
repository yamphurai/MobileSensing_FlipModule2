# MobileSensing_FlipModule2
Details
- use lazy instantiation whenever possible
- deallocate any memory properly
- Update the code to use a UITableViewController as the main entry point of the app. It's fine to use static cells
  When you click on the top cell, it should open the original ViewController (the previous entry point).
